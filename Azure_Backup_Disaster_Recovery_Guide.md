# ✅ Azure Backup & Disaster Recovery Guide

## 📘 Introduction
This guide explains how to protect your business applications in the cloud using Azure backup and disaster recovery tools. We'll keep things simple and focus on practical steps you can take.

## 🧠 What are RTO and RPO?

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time it should take to restore your systems after a disaster.  
  *Example:* “We need to be back online within 4 hours.”

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.  
  *Example:* “We can't lose more than 1 hour of data.”

## 🚨 Disaster Recovery Strategy

### 1. Risk Assessment

Start by listing what could go wrong:
- Server failures
- Network outages
- Database corruption
- Human errors
- Natural disasters
- Cyber attacks

### 2. Application Classification

| Category | Description                          | Typical RTO | Typical RPO |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Critical | Business cannot operate without these| < 1 hour    | < 15 minutes|
| Important| Major functions impacted             | < 4 hours   | < 1 hour    |
| Normal   | Business can operate with workarounds| < 24 hours  | < 24 hours  |
| Low      | Minimal business impact              | < 72 hours  | < 48 hours  |

### 3. Backup Strategy

#### For Different Components:

**Virtual Machines:**
- Daily backups for most systems
- Hourly backups for critical systems
- Store backups in a different region

**Databases:**
- Full backups weekly
- Differential backups daily
- Transaction log backups every 15–60 minutes
- Consider Azure SQL with geo-replication

**Files & Configuration:**
- Regular backups of key files
- Store infrastructure config as code (ARM templates)

### 4. Disaster Recovery Options in Azure

#### Option 1: Backup and Restore
- **How it works:** Take regular backups and restore when needed
- **Best for:** Non-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery

#### Option 2: Pilot Light
- **How it works:** Keep core systems in standby
- **Best for:** Medium-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Site Recovery

#### Option 3: Warm Standby
- **How it works:** Run scaled-down environment
- **Best for:** Important apps
- **Tools:** Azure Traffic Manager, secondary regions

#### Option 4: Hot Standby / Active-Active
- **How it works:** Duplicate systems in multiple regions
- **Best for:** Mission-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Front Door, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL geo-replication

### 5. Testing Your DR Plan
- Schedule quarterly DR drills
- Document steps and recovery time
- Time your recovery procedures
- Update strategy based on test results

## 🛠️ Setting Up Automated Backups in Azure

### Example: VM Backups

#### 🔹 Create a Recovery Services Vault:
1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Search "Recovery Services vaults" → Click "Create"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: `CompanyBackupVault`
   - Region
   - Resource Group

4. Click "Review + Create" → "Create"

#### 🔹 Configure Backup Policy:
1. Go to your vault → Click "Backup"
2. Select "Virtual machine" → "Start discovery"
3. Click "Create a new policy"
   - Set schedule, retention, etc.
4. Click "OK"

#### 🔹 Select VMs to Back Up:
1. Check VMs to back up → Click "Enable backup"

💡 Backups will now run automatically based on policy.

### Example: Azure SQL Database Backups

Azure SQL auto-creates:
- Full backups: Weekly
- Differential: Daily
- Log backups: Every 5–10 minutes

To configure long-term retention:
1. Go to Azure SQL → "Manage backups"
2. Set:
   - Weekly: 1–520 weeks
   - Monthly: 1–120 months
   - Yearly: 1–10 years

## 📊 Monitoring Backup Status

- Go to Recovery Services vault → Check "Backup Jobs"
- Set alerts for failed/incomplete jobs

## ✅ Conclusion

A solid disaster recovery plan helps ensure:
- Minimal downtime (RTO)
- Minimal data loss (RPO)

📝 Key Reminders:
- Know your RTO/RPO
- Test recovery often
- Keep documentation updated
- Review strategy as apps evolve

By leveraging Azure Backup & DR tools, your business can bounce back from disasters with confidence.

##  What are RTO and RPO?

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time it should take to restore your systems after a disaster.  
  *Example:* ‚ÄúWe need to be back online within 4 hours.‚Äù

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.  
  *Example:* ‚ÄúWe can't lose more than 1 hour of data.‚Äù

## üö® Disaster Recovery Strategy

### 1. Risk Assessment

Start by listing what could go wrong:
- Server failures
- Network outages
- Database corruption
- Human errors
- Natural disasters
- Cyber attacks

### 2. Application Classification

| Category | Description                          | Typical RTO | Typical RPO |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Critical | Business cannot operate without these| < 1 hour    | < 15 minutes|
| Important| Major functions impacted             | < 4 hours   | < 1 hour    |
| Normal   | Business can operate with workarounds| < 24 hours  | < 24 hours  |
| Low      | Minimal business impact              | < 72 hours  | < 48 hours  |

### 3. Backup Strategy

#### For Different Components:

**Virtual Machines:**
- Daily backups for most systems
- Hourly backups for critical systems
- Store backups in a different region

**Databases:**
- Full backups weekly
- Differential backups daily
- Transaction log backups every 15‚Äì60 minutes
- Consider Azure SQL with geo-replication

**Files & Configuration:**
- Regular backups of key files
- Store infrastructure config as code (ARM templates)

### 4. Disaster Recovery Options in Azure

#### Option 1: Backup and Restore
- **How it works:** Take regular backups and restore when needed
- **Best for:** Non-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery

#### Option 2: Pilot Light
- **How it works:** Keep core systems in standby
- **Best for:** Medium-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Site Recovery

#### Option 3: Warm Standby
- **How it works:** Run scaled-down environment
- **Best for:** Important apps
- **Tools:** Azure Traffic Manager, secondary regions

#### Option 4: Hot Standby / Active-Active
- **How it works:** Duplicate systems in multiple regions
- **Best for:** Mission-critical apps
- **Tools:** Azure Front Door, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL geo-replication

### 5. Testing Your DR Plan
- Schedule quarterly DR drills
- Document steps and recovery time
- Time your recovery procedures
- Update strategy based on test results

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Automated Backups in Azure

### Example: VM Backups

#### üîπ Create a Recovery Services Vault:
1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Search "Recovery Services vaults" ‚Üí Click "Create"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: `CompanyBackupVault`
   - Region
   - Resource Group

4. Click "Review + Create" ‚Üí "Create"

#### üîπ Configure Backup Policy:
1. Go to your vault ‚Üí Click "Backup"
2. Select "Virtual machine" ‚Üí "Start discovery"
3. Click "Create a new policy"
   - Set schedule, retention, etc.
4. Click "OK"

#### üîπ Select VMs to Back Up:
1. Check VMs to back up ‚Üí Click "Enable backup"

üí° Backups will now run automatically based on policy.

### Example: Azure SQL Database Backups

Azure SQL auto-creates:
- Full backups: Weekly
- Differential: Daily
- Log backups: Every 5‚Äì10 minutes

To configure long-term retention:
1. Go to Azure SQL ‚Üí "Manage backups"
2. Set:
   - Weekly: 1‚Äì520 weeks
   - Monthly: 1‚Äì120 months
   - Yearly: 1‚Äì10 years

## üìä Monitoring Backup Status

- Go to Recovery Services vault ‚Üí Check "Backup Jobs"
- Set alerts for failed/incomplete jobs

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

A solid disaster recovery plan helps ensure:
- Minimal downtime (RTO)
- Minimal data loss (RPO)

üìù Key Reminders:
- Know your RTO/RPO
- Test recovery often
- Keep documentation updated
- Review strategy as apps evolve

By leveraging Azure Backup & DR tools, your business can bounce back from disasters with confidence.
